The awesome technology collection 😎
====================================

This is a collection of resources, some simply interesting, some are my personal picks and tools that I use on a daily basis. There will always be new tools and resources coming up on this page and feel free to contribute! 

> Everything here is picked on the criteria on making your workflow more efficient or by providing a tool for a problem you are trying to solve.



--------

## General

Never forget, google is your friend.

- [The "awesome" list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) - 😎 Awesome lists about all kinds of interesting topics! Including topics like *'programming languages', 'computer science', 'machine learning', 'game/app development', 'business', 'technological theories (whitepapers)', 'free books'.*
- [Medium](https://medium.com) - **Get smarter about what matters to you 📖,** basically a platform/search engine for articles & blogs. I use it on a daily basis for articles on my favourite topics, that are more in-depth, but still quite bite-sized. Some "inaccessible" articles can be accessed, when opening the link to it, in a private window/session.
- Learn **Markdown**! It is becoming increasingly more important and you should really be using it for a **faster paced writing workflow ⚡️**, for nearly any situation of writing. It is also a *must-recommend* to learn! Here are some starting-off tips: [Medium article](https://medium.com/@itsjzt/beginner-guide-to-markdown-229adce30074), [Github guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 
  - Later, if you want to go really deep into *text formatting*, require mathematic or scientific equations or writing a thesis or important essay, have a look at *LaTeX!* Here is a comprehensive, yet thorough guide: [LATEX for Beginners, Edition 5, March 2014](http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/skills/documents/3722/3722-2014.pdf) 
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) - you *got to* know reddit. It is *"the front page of the internet"*. Whatever happens on the internet, or any topic you wish to explore to further depths with the help of open collaboration, there is probably a reddit *"sub-reddit"* for it.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) - GitHub hosts data for you and adds *"versioning control"* via the *git* protocol. It is *extremely* powerful and is an absolute recommendation to use! You can use it to store your written work, code, notes, *et cetera.* Using it will make sure you never have duplicate documents and never have ones named "final final draft" or "submission01". 

## Education

[Class Central](http://classcentral.com) - a search engine and reviews site for free *'Massive Open Online Courses'* (MOOC's).

## Mac Tips

- [iCloud drive intro](https://medium.com/@mikemurphyco/211-icloud-101-the-complete-guide-backup-plan-697e763374b5) - though it is outdated since the release of IOS13. I will release a guide myself, as far as there is no good alternative. iCloud drive is incredibly powerful and everybody in the apple ecosystem should be using it cross-device!

- [Some basic shortcuts](https://medium.com/popular-science/20-essential-mac-keyboard-shortcuts-to-save-you-a-click-36a1d71216aa)

- [Another few tips](https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-set-up-your-mac-for-focused-work-ab3565750059)

## Computer Science / Programming 💻 

> You actually *need to* learn *git* and use GitHub to seem somewhat like you know what you're doing.

- ["Awesome" Python Resources](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#readme) - 🐍 Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources.

- [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com) - ⌚️Learn any programming language, quickly and briefly

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - THE community for crowd-solving problems.

  ### The command line

- [Introduction into the *command-line*](https://github.com/ChristopherA/intro-mac-command-line/blob/master/part1-basics.md) - GitHub user's guide

- [Terminal for beginners](https://medium.com/@grace.m.nolan/terminal-for-beginners-e492ba10902a) - Medium article

- [Awesome mac command line tips/commands](https://github.com/herrbischoff/awesome-macos-command-line)

- After understanding the basics, try having a look at [the art of command line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line#macos-only) guide.



## Apps

- [Beautiful.ai](http://beautiful.ai/) - An artificial intelligence powered powerpoint upgrade! Automatically takes care of animations, positioning, color scheme etc. 
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) - *"Write, plan, collaborate, and get organized. Notion is all you need — in one tool."*, *"The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases"*. Arguably one of *the best* tools for organising, planning and complex thinking! 💭  

### Text Editors

- [Typora](http://typora.io) - A **beautiful**, minimal *markdown* editor!
- Vim - If you're already acquainted with the *command-line* and the shell, then *VIM* is going to take your coding/writing to the absolutely furthest level possible today, by making use of modi, macros and shortcuts. Also, for much more customisation options, it is the best alternative to any text-based editor.

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) - see above.

### Security

> Go check how long it would take a hacker, in the worst case, to crack your password, by random guessing: [How secure is my password?](https://howsecureismypassword.net)

I am using **pass;** a guide on that: [password-store guide](https://medium.com/@chasinglogic/the-definitive-guide-to-password-store-c337a8f023a1). It is using GPG-keys, git for synchronisation and has an IOS app. There are also many different 'clients' for available for mac.

- There are a lot of password managers out there (and *yes!*), you should be using a password manager! But *all* of them work using a relatively costly subscription model; open-source password managers may even be more secure than proprietary ones and are **free!** 
  - Dashlane
  - 1Password
  - Lastpass

- [macpassapp](https://macpassapp.org) - *"A free, open-source, KeePass-compatible password manager for macOS."* (I haven't actually tried this one.)
- [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org) - Encryption- either the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or the Twofish algorithm are used. (It is quite ugly.)
