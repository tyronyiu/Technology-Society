The awesome technology collection üòé
====================================

This is a collection of resources, some simply interesting, some are my personal picks and tools that I use on a daily basis. There will always be new tools and resources coming up on this page and feel free to contribute! 

> Everything here is picked on the criteria on making your workflow more efficient or by providing a tool for a problem you are trying to solve.

--------

## General

- [The "awesome" list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) - üòé Awesome lists about all kinds of interesting topics! Including topics like 'programming languages', 'computer science', 'machine learning', 'game/app development', 'business', 'technological theories (whitepapers)', 'free books'.

- [Medium](https://medium.com) - **Get smarter about what matters to you üìñ,** basically a platform/search engine for articles & blogs. I use it on a daily basis for articles on my favourite topics, that are more in-depth, but still quite bite-sized.

- [Class Central](http://classcentral.com) - a search engine and reviews site for free *'Massive Open Online Courses'* (MOOC's).
- Learn **Markdown**! It is becoming increasingly more important and you should really be using it for a **faster paced writing workflow ‚ö°Ô∏è**, for nearly any situation of writing. It is also a *must-recommend* to learn! Here are some starting-off tips: [Medium article](https://medium.com/@itsjzt/beginner-guide-to-markdown-229adce30074), [Github guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 
  - Later, if you want to go really deep into *text formatting*, require mathematic or scientific equations or writing a thesis or important essay, have a look at *LaTeX!* Here is a comprehensive, yet thorough guide: [LATEX for Beginners, Edition 5, March 2014](http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/skills/documents/3722/3722-2014.pdf) 
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) - you *got to* know reddit. It is *"the front page of the internet"*. Whatever happens on the internet, or any topic you wish to explore to further depths with the help of open collaboration, there is probably a reddit *"sub-reddit"* for it.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) - GitHub hosts data for you and adds *"versioning control"* via the *git* protocol. It is *extremely* powerful and is an absolute recommendation to use! You can use it to store your written work, code, notes, *et cetera.* Using it will make sure you never have duplicate documents and never have ones named "final final draft" or "submission01". 

## Computer Science / Programming üíª 

> You actually *need to* learn *git* and use GitHub to seem somewhat like you know what you're doing.

- ["Awesome" Python Resources](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#readme) - üêç Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources.
- [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com) - ‚åöÔ∏èLearn any programming language, quickly and briefly



## Apps

- [Typora](http://typora.io) - A **beautiful**, minimal *markdown* editor!
- [Beautiful.ai](http://beautiful.ai/) - An artificial intelligence powered powerpoint upgrade! Automatically takes care of animations, positioning, color scheme etc. 
- Vim - If you're already acquainted with the *command-line* and the shell, then *VIM* is going to take your coding/writing to the absolutely furthest level possible today, by making use of modi, macros and shortcuts. Also, for much more customisation options, it is the best alternative to any text-based editor.

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) - *"Write, plan, collaborate, and get organized. Notion is all you need ‚Äî in one tool."*, *"The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases"*. Arguably one of *the best* tools for organising, planning and complex thinking! üí≠
